## How It Works

### IPTV Player
Loads curated free IPTV channels (beIN Sports, Fox Sports, etc.) and streams them via HLS.js through a local proxy to handle CORS. When a live football match is available from the Sports section, a prominent red "Live Match" card appears at the top of the channel list.

### IPTV Catalog
Fetches M3U playlists from **two sources** in parallel (iptv-org + Free-TV), deduplicates by stream URL, and merges into a single unified catalog. Supports search, category filtering, and country filtering.

### Live Sports
Connects to the SportSRC API to display upcoming match schedules across 9 sport categories. Selecting a match loads embedded stream players directly from `embed.st`.

### Stream Music
The music portal connects to two free APIs:
- **Radio Browser API** — No authentication required. Search 45K+ stations by name, genre, or country. Streams play directly via HTML5 Audio with Media Session API integration.
- **Invidious API** — Privacy-friendly YouTube frontend. Searches YouTube for music videos and plays them via the YouTube IFrame API for full playback control.

All user data (volume, favorites, playlists, recently played) is persisted to `localStorage` under the `streamhub-music` key.

### URL Hash Routing
Active tab state is stored in the URL hash (`#home`, `#iptv`, `#catalog`, `#sports`, `#music`). Refreshing the page restores the last-viewed section. Browser back/forward navigation works correctly.
